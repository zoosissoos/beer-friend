## Future Developments: 

Although this is just for basic functionality, I plan on adding more featers such as contact information for a matching friend.

In the future this would use database instead of a dummy page with user objects.


## Deployment

This has been deployed via [GitHub Pages](https://zoosissoos.github.io/beer-friend/).
