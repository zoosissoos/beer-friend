This app was created as a project to demonstrate understanding of API calls. It is a mock app where users can fill out a survey and be matched with a friend that shares similar beer tastes.

## Prerequisites/Technologies Used

* CSS
* Materialize
* Javascript
* Node.js
* Express

## Installation

## Future Developments: 

Although this is just for basic functionality to demonstrate understanding of APIs, I plan on adding more features such as contact information for a matching friend.

This would also integrate a user database instead of a mock user file.


## Deployment

This has been deployed via [Heroku](https://calm-dusk-49591.herokuapp.com/).
